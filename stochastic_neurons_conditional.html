    <h1 class="title"> Using stochastic neurons for conditional computation</h1>
    <p class=date> Apr 27, 2014 </p>
    <p>As stated in my previous <a class="reference external" href="/gammatone.html">post</a>, I had some issues when trying to train
my network while using sparse-coded speech frames as input/output. The
network was getting stuck at the same point after processing a single
batch, and processing additional batches did anything training-wise
(performance, weights, etc., were all stuck). I tried different
initialization ranges for the weight matrices, a different learning
rate, different network architectures (unit types, different number of
units and layers) but the results were still the same.</p>
<p>In the same post, I talked about sparsity not being enforced at the
output. Since the whole dataset was sparse-coded and we were trying to
predict the vector of sparse coefficients for the next frame, all
outputs were expected to be as sparse as the inputs. This post
describes what I did to try to mitigate this issue. I used stochastic
neurons that enforce sparsity in the output layer of a network with
the same architecture as the previous network. This brings in the
problem of propagating gradients through stochastic units, but
fortunately David Warde-Farley pointed me to a paper which presents
some alternative solutions <a class="citation-reference" href="#bengio2013" id="id1">[Bengio2013]</a>.</p>
<p>The units I used at the output layer are similar to the ones called
&quot;Stochastic times Smooth&quot; (STS) in <a class="citation-reference" href="#bengio2013" id="id2">[Bengio2013]</a>. The idea is that the
output of a neuron is equal to the product of a stochastic part
(sampled from a binomial distribution with probability
<span class="math">\(\sqrt{p_i}\)</span>
) and a smooth part (for example, a sigmoid or a
linear function). The value of <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>
 itself comes from a
non-linear computation based on the unit's input. The stochastic
part serves as a &quot;gater&quot; which prevents the activation with a
probability determined by the activation at the &quot;gater path&quot; of the
unit. A sparsity constraint is imposed by a combination of the
KL-divergence criterion for the sigmoids in the &quot;gater path&quot; of the
unit with added noise (as explained in sections 1 and 2 of Appendix A
in the referred paper).</p>
<!-- add image showing how the STS unit is structured -->
<p>I found an implementation for these units by one of the authors
(Nicholas Léonard) at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/delicious">GitHub</a>, and updated it to the current Pylearn2
interface. His implementation had support for &quot;hybrid&quot; STS units which
are semi-stochastic (i.e., part of the output is deterministic), but I
did not use it. These units have a 2-layer non-linear gater path (I
used two sigmoidal layers) and a linear path for the output.</p>
<p>Now, for the results: sadly, switching to these units made no
significant difference at first. I did some tests using the same
training/testing/validation sets from Vincent's TIMIT dataset but
filtering it such that there were only sentences from male
speakers. The network was still stuck at the same objective value
after the first epoch. So, I decided to take a look on an alternative
hypothesis: maybe less sparsity/a different sparse coding
configuration could help?</p>
<div class="section" id="using-an-undercomplete-gammatone-dictionary">
<h2>Using an undercomplete gammatone dictionary</h2>
<p>After I have seen that tinkering with the hyperparameters and
switching the output layer to an STS layer did not solve my problem, I
decided to play a bit with the inputs/outputs I was using. My sparse
coding scheme was resulting in a very sparse representation, as each
frame with 160 samples was being represented by up to 16 sparse coding
coefficients. Since the dictionary had 950 different atoms, it means
that only approximately 1.7% of the coefficients were non-zero, both
in the input and in the output. Note that while the quality of the
reconstruction is acceptable (as you can listen in the samples below),
this gives us no idea on whether it is a good representation
phone-wise (i.e., if there's any relationship between the chosen atoms
and specific phones). Given the poor results I had with the previous
representation, I guess the representation I chose could be one of the
culprits for the bad performance.</p>
<p>To test the effect of a different sparse representation, I decided to
switch the dictionary used by my sparse coding scheme to an
undercomplete dictionary (i.e., a dictionary where the number of atoms
is smaller than the length of each atom), using longer frames and
increasing the overlap to 87.5% instead of 50%. Another thing that
motivated this change was realizing my previous dictionary still had a
big problem: a dictionary with atoms with length 160 was not able to
hold full atoms for frequencies lower than 1000 Hz, as the envelope
for lower frequency atoms decay is slower than for high-frequency
ones. To be able to have atoms for the desired frequency range (150 to
8000 Hz), I would need to increase the atom length. However, the
tradeoff between atom length and number of atoms in an overcomplete
dictionary would make the sparse coefficient vector even longer than
the one I had (950 coefficients). I made some experiments with an
undercomplete dictionary with longer frames (1600 samples, equivalent
to 100 ms at 16 kHz sampling rate) and more frequency values for the
gammatones (64, instead of 50), and felt that the reconstruction
quality decreased a bit. However, increasing the overlap between
samples led to a decent reconstruction quality. You can listen to the
original sample and the three reconstructed samples below:</p>

<div class="section" id="trouble-with-a-capital-t-as-in-import-theano-tensor-as-t">
<h2>Trouble with a capital T (as in <tt class="docutils literal">import theano.tensor as T</tt>)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, even after switching the previous dataset by the one
generated with the undercomplete dictionary, the behavior of my
network during training was still the same... with the added problem
of NaNs appearing eventually after being stuck for around 30
iterations (with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfsantos/ift6266h14/blob/master/experiments/mlp_sparse/sp1600_conditional.yaml">this</a> YAML file, which uses only a bunch of sentences
from the validation set to save processing time). I am not sure on
what is causing this and searching at the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pylearn-users/yr-i_RzY9a0">pylearn-users</a> mailing
list, I have seen that David Krueger also had a <a class="reference external" href="http://dskspeechsynthesis.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/no-more-nans/">similar issue</a>
recently. In my case, using the <tt class="docutils literal">nan_guard</tt> as suggested by Ian in
this thread showed that the error happened during the computation of a
weight matrix inside the STS layer, namely the second weight matrix
used in the gater path of the unit (second layer of the non-linear
part). The error log is very low level as you can see <a class="reference external" href="files/0.err">here</a>, which
makes sense since it comes from inside an optimized Theano
graph. Altering the sparsity target in the output layer seems to avoid
this, but the results are still the same. Additionally, the predicted
coefficients are very far from the sparsity target I have set for the
output layer: 10% of the coefficients should be non-zero, but I am
getting something close to 50% instead (approximately 750 non-zero
coefficients per frame).</p>
<p>Here is an example of an audio file generated with the trained
network, using the previous frame and the previous, current, and next
phone as input:</p>
<p> <audio controls="controls" >
      <source src="files/test_sparse.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />

</audio> </p><p>(Yes, it does not sound like speech at all.)</p>

<div class="section" id="ideas-for-the-future">
<h2>Ideas for the future?</h2>
<p>None of my experiments led to results that would convince one that
using a sparse representation based on gammatones would be a useful
thing for speech synthesis. Architectures using time-domain audio
samples as the input/output had much more exciting results. Looking
forward, I would like to experiment with my other representation based
on the gammatonegram and convolutional neural nets. As the
gammatonegram for consecutive frames can be seen as an image (where
each time-frequency cell is a &quot;pixel&quot;), the usual 2D CNNs could be
tested.</p>
<p>Even though our course is over, my PhD research topic is speech
processing, so I believe I'll continue playing with deep learning in
the future. I am interested in investigating applications of deep
learning to speech enhancement systems. There is a very recent paper
(to appear in this year's ICASSP) where the authors used a DNN to
learn spectral masks to reduce reverberation in speech signals
<a class="citation-reference" href="#han2014" id="id3">[Han2014]</a>. It would be interesting to see if a similar idea could be
used not only for reverberation, but for speech enhancement under
different kinds of environment. Other ideas will hopefully pop-up
along the way!</p>
